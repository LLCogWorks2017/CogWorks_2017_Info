While Jupyter notebooks are great for doing rapid prototyping of code and highly-interactive tasks like data analysis, your efforts to 
develop your own cognitive assistants will entail a large amount of "traditional" coding of Python scripts/packages (a Python package is 
simply a directory containing Python scripts, which can be imported by other Python code).

An IDE allows you to write and edit scripts, which you should save with the .py extension. Commands in a Python script get interpreted 
from top to bottom when you run python my_script.py in your terminal: `python my_script.py`.

Having a good development environment is crucial for writing Python scripts. The following are some recommended Python editors. They 
provide nice color coding, syntax-checking, and many other capabilities to facilitate the code-writing process.

### Some Recommended Editors
  - [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
     - easy and powerful... it just works. The only downside is that it only works for Python, whereas other editors are more general. It can also be a little intimidating to use at first
  - [Visual Studio Code + Python add-ons](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
     - VSCode is a general editor, so you can use it with other languages. Not as polished and powerful as PyCharm.
  - [Atom + Python](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python)
     - Direct competitor/very similar to VSCode. 
  - [Sublime + Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/)
  - [emacs + Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/emacs-the-best-python-editor/) 
     - This is *not* easy to get going with... but it can be fun and pretty powerful once you put some serious work into it.
  - [vim + Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/) 
     - same remarks as for emacs... not a walk in the park, but some people really love tinkering with vim & emacs
