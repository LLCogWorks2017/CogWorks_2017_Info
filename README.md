# Student Checklist
- Pen/pencil & notebook
- Completed programming assignments available on computer
- A text editor that you are comfortable with, for editing Python code. Recommendations:
  - [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
     - easy and powerful... it just works. The only downside is that it only works for Python, whereas other editors are more general. It can also be a little intimidating to use at first
  - [Visual Studio Code + Python add-ons](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
     - VSCode is a general editor, so you can use it with other languages. Not as polished and powerful as PyCharm.
  - [Atom + Python](http://www.marinamele.com/install-and-configure-atom-editor-for-python)
     - Direct competitor/very similar to VSCode. 
  - [Sublime + Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/)
     - 
  - [emacs + Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/emacs-the-best-python-editor/) 
     - This is *not* easy to get going with... but it can be fun and pretty powerful once you put some serious work into it.
  - [vim + Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/) 
     - same remarks as for emacs... not a walk in the park, but some people really love tinkering with vim & emacs
