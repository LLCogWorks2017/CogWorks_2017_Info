# Student Checklist
- If you do not have a laptop available to you, or if your laptop cannot run applications like Jupyter notebooks, please contact an instructor or BWSI administrator ASAP. We will happily work with you to arrange for a computer to be made available. 
- Pen/pencil & notebook
- Several audio files (e.g. .mp3) of some of your favorite songs available on your computer.
    - If you have a pair of headphones/ear buds, bring them. **Do not buy headphones for this course!** 
 - (Optional) Upload ~5 photos of yourself (and no one else!), jpg or png files, labelled with your first and last name (e.g. Melanie_Chen1.jpg, Melanie_Chen2.jpg, and so forth).

    - These pictures **will not be shared or posted to any of the other students or faculty**. The pictures will be processed by a simple algorithm that the instructors wrote **and the pictures will be promptly deleted afterwards**. 
- Completed programming assignments available on your computer
- A text editor that you are comfortable with, for editing Python code. Please read [our recommendations](https://github.com/LLCogWorks2017/CogWorks_2017_Info/blob/master/TextEditorsRecs.md).
 - Anaconda with at least Python 3.5 installed on it (3.6 has some nice features - consider reinstalling anaconda with 3.6 or creating a [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) with python 3.6).
     - When installing Anaconda, there is an installation option: `Allow Anaconda to add itself to your path (not recommended)`; we advise you to **enable** this installation option.
     - If you haven't done this in a while, run `conda update --all`. This will update all of your Python packages installed via conda. This will **not** upgrade Python 3.5 to 3.6.
- [git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - **Windows users: you must do this by [installing Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)**. During installation, it will ask
      you if you want to install the mintty terminal, which comes with linux/unix utilities enabled: **ENABLE THIS OPTION**. Another installation option will ask if you want Windows-styled line endings (CRLF) to be converted to linux-style endings (LF): **ENABLE THIS OPTION**.
- [A GitHub account](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration)
    - Email Ryan Soklaski or Melanie Chen, telling them what your GitHub username is. You will be added to [the LLCogWorks2017 GitHub Group](https://github.com/LLCogWorks2017)
- [Connect git with your GitHub account, via SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) by following the steps in the linked page. This will save your GitHub login information (in a secure way) on your computer, allowing you to seamlessly push/pull to/from your GitHub repositories from your local computer.
- [An Amazon account](https://www.amazon.com/ap/register?openid.pape.max_auth_age=0&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fyourstore%2Fhome%3Fie%3DUTF8%26action%3Dsign-out%26path%3D%252Fgp%252Fyourstore%252Fhome%26ref_%3Dnav_youraccount_signout%26signIn%3D1%26useRedirectOnSuccess%3D1&prevRID=9XY567S7KM66T13ZQFY9&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.ns.pape=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fextensions%2Fpape%2F1.0&prepopulatedLoginId=&failedSignInCount=0&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&pageId=usflex&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0) (be sure to remember your login info!).
