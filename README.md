# Student Checklist
- Pen/pencil & notebook
- Completed programming assignments available on computer
- A text editor that you are comfortable with, for editing Python code. Please read [our recommendations](https://github.com/LLCogWorks2017/CogWorks_2017_Info/blob/master/TextEditorsRecs.md).
 - Anaconda with at least Python 3.5 installed on it (3.6 has some nice features - consider reinstalling anaconda with 3.6 or creating a [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) with python 3.6).
     - When installing Anaconda, there is an installation option: `Allow Anaconda to add itself to your path (not recommended)`; we advise you to **enable** this installation option.
- [Install git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - Windows users: you must do this by [installing GIt Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). During installation, it will ask
      you if you want to install the mintty terminal, which comes with linux/unix utilities enables **ENABLE THIS OPTION**.
- [Create a GitHub account](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration)
- [Connect git with your GitHub account with SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) by following the steps in the linked page. This will save your GitHub login information (in a secure way) on your computer, allowing you to seamlessly push/pull to/from your GitHub repositories from your local computer.
